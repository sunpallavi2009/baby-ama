The company supplied chicks, poultry feed, medicine, and related equipment to other poultry companies in the area.     \",\"ourstorySection1Para2txt\":\"Three years go by as they built a reputation for themselves among the local poultry growers, who saw Suguna Foods as a go-to company for all poultry needs.

Under this model, Suguna provides everything a farmer needs for poultry farming: day-old-chicks, feed, medicines, and equipment. All a farmer needs to have is a hygienic space and a clean water source to raise the birds. When birds are fully grown, the company itself buys back from the farmers. This cut middlemen\'s costs and promised the farmers a stable income.\",\"ourstorySection1Para4txt\":\"To standardize the contract farming model, Suguna Foods brought in the idea of “Poultry Integration”, wherein all the essentials needed for fruitful poultry farming including feed, vaccines, medicines, pre-mix, and equipment would be manufactured by various entities of the organization, collectively called as Suguna Group. This way Suguna set a benchmark for high-quality agro products. Through Poultry Integration, Suguna Group not only fulfilled its needs but also the needs of other players in the industry.\",\"ourstorySection1JourneyAccTitle3\":\" Taking a holistic approach\",\"ourstorySection1Para5txt\":\"Improving nutritional security has been one of the core objectives that Suguna Group has committed to.
